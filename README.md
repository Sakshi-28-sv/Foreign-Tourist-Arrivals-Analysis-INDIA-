(https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html?path=Tourist.ipynb) 
Overview

Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) analysis provides insights into the trends, seasonal patterns, and country-wise distribution of foreign tourists visiting India. This analysis helps in understanding growth trends, predicting future arrivals, and identifying key contributors to India’s tourism sector.

Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this analysis covers the years 2023 to 2024. It is not the exact real-world data but rather a sample dataset created based on government official news releases. The data has been generated by predicting values based on the numbers provided to the public at the end or beginning of the year by the government. This approach ensures a structured and realistic dataset for analysis while acknowledging that actual values may vary.

How It Works

The analysis is structured into six parts:

1. Data Collection & Pre-processing – Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.


2. Visualization of FTAs Trends – Plotting the monthly FTAs trends.


3. Country-wise Distribution – Analyzing the contribution of different countries.


4. Growth Rate Analysis – Evaluating year-over-year (YoY) growth.


5. Seasonal Decomposition – Identifying seasonal trends.


6. Forecasting FTAs – Using time series forecasting models.
